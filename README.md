# Clusteranalysis

The Branch 'master' contains own implementations of KMeans, Divisive, Agglomerative and DBSCAN clustering algorithms.
It also contains a sample jupyter notebook to try the different algorithms (own implementation & usage of sklearn) and play around with their parameters.
All results are visualized.
